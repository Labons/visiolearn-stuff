if first time kayo magsetup here's what u need

git
Node.js (to install stuff thru node package manager)
github acc (duh)
the .env stuff ask me directly for it to access the database and other things (.env is where u store the super secret stuff)

so once that's done

1. make a folder to store the files in
2. open terminal or any command line interface stuff that works
3. in the terminal, use cd command to change directory to the folder u made
4. clone the repository by typing "git clone https://github.com/Labons/visiolearn-stuff.git"
it should make a folder where it has all the files that is present in the github repo
5. then CD to the repo u cloned (the folder of visiolearn) then type "npm install" to install the packages used by the app
6. make a .env file that has all the secret things like password ni mongodb to access datababse
